## Git Structure

We use the git-flow model to structure our branches. This means you won't see a lot of activity on the master branch besides releases.
Most of the magic happens in the develop branch.
[More about git-flow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/)

It's strongly recommended that you download the [git-flow client](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow) and "publish" each feature branch you would like to see merged into the core. This way all features are not version-dependant and you can make as many changes as you like without needing them all to be merged in order.
