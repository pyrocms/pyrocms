# Home

Welcome to the Fizl example. The whole structure of this site is being generated by flat files - either HTML or markdown (.md) files! Even the navigation above is auto-generated from these flat files.

You can find the file with this content in **content/index.html**.

The template being used to generate the home page is **assets/templates/home.html**.

To get started on your own Fizl site, you can either delete the files inside **content** and start from scratch, or edit what's there.
