<p>The Users module works together with Groups and Permissions to give PyroCMS 
access control.</p>

<h4>Add a User</h4>
<p>Fill out the user's details (including a password) and save. If you have 
activation emails enabled in Settings an email will be sent to the new user 
with an activation link.</p>

<h4>Activating New Users</h4>
<p>If activation emails are disabled in Settings users that register on the 
website front-end will appear under the Inactive Users menu item until you 
either approve or delete their account. If activation emails are enabled users 
may register silently, without an admin's help.</p>"; #translate
