In most themes the Header group is the main navigation. Check your theme's documentation to find out which navigation groups are supported in the theme files. If you want to display a group within site content just use this tag: {{ navigation:links group=\"your-group-name\" }}</p><h4>Adding Links</h4><p>Choose a title for your link, then select the group that you wish for it to display in.Link types are as follows:<ul><li>URL: an external link - http://google.com</li><li>Site Link: a link within your site - galleries/portfolio-pictures</li><li>Module: takes a visitor to the index page of a module</li><li>Page: link to a page</li></ul>Target specifies if this link should open in a new browser window or tab. (Tip: use New Window sparingly to avoid annoying your site visitors.)The Class field allows you to add a css class to a single link.</p><p></p><h4>Ordering Navigation Links</h4><p>The order of your links in the admin panel are reflected on the website front-end. To change the order that they appear simply drag and drop them until they are in the order that you like.</p>";
